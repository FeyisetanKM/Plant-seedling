# Plant-seedling
Plant seedling classification is a fundamental task in agriculture and environmental science, aiming to identify and categorize different plant species at the seedling stage. The ability to accurately classify seedlings is crucial for various applications, including weed detection, crop monitoring, biodiversity assessment, and ecosystem management.
Data Augmentation and hyperparameter tuning was used.
Using a third convolution layer and starting with sixteen filters, followed by another 32 and then 64 filters improved the model a bit.
